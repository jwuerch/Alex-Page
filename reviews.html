				<h1>Client Reviews</h1>

<h4>Great Attorney!</h4>
<span class="review">Alex is a great attorney! He returns emails and calls promptly and kept me informed at every step while representing me. He listened, understood the issues, and cared about my situation. Alex was always well prepared and was fabulous in court. I can't thank Alex enough for the excellent work he did for me!</span>

<li><h4>Highly satisfied former client</h4>
<span class="review">Mr. Higgins dedicated himself to representing my case against my former employer after I was terminated due to a health issue. He was extremely knowledgeable, highly professional and compassionate. I was very pleased with the settlement I received, as well as the representation he provided. He fully intimidated the officers of a corporation with multi-billion annual revenues (my former employer) by presenting my case brilliantly.</span>

<li><h4>Class Act person . . .</h4>
<span class="review">Alex fights for you like family. Your best interest is his bottomline. He responds to your questions immediately and with caring answers of your concerns. I felt very important to Alex and that my case counted. Many times I wanted to give up but with Alex's capabilities, experience and diligence he was able to get me a satisfactory settlement when I thought all avenue's had been exhausted. Alex also is a nice guy full of kindness and ethics. I would recommend Alex in a heartbeat in employment law.</span>

<li><h4>The Best Lawyer to Have in Your Corner</h4>
<span class="review">I was in a life altering situation that had the potential change my future and the future of my family forever. I was referred to Mr Higgins by someone I trusted and it was one of the best decision I ever made. Mr. Higgins is a person of incredible integrity. He is smart, compassionate, well informed, knows the law and is well respected in the legal community. He kept me informed weekly and whenever there was any change or new developement. The first day of proceedings, opposing counsel consisted of 5 attorneys. Mr. Higgins wasn't even phased, he was well prepared and waded right into the fray, destroyed the opposing side's case and emerge the clear winner. Alex Higgins never forgot that I was a real person and a family man who was being wronged and needed his help. Maybe that's because he has a family of his own. I would wholeheartedly recommend Alex Higgins to anyone in need of legal counsel, but especially those I care about.</span>

<li><h4>Great Attorney</h4>
<span class="review">I hired Mr. Higgins in 2010 when I was wrongfully terminated. The first thing that I noticed about him was that he was frank and to the point. He was certainly not going to waste time. I learned to appreciate this considering lawyers charge hourly. He always kept me informed on what was going on and made sure I understood everything that was happening. I ended up settling in this situation and not filing a law suit. He later represented me in a business dispute I had. In this situation both Mr. Higgins and I thought it would be an open and shut case. It turned out to be the complete opposite. We ended up having depositions, mediation and then ended up going to arbitration. It was quite a lengthy process and quite exhausting. What I learned about Mr. Higgins during this time is he will not give up! He worked so hard for me. He was amazing. I was very impressed with him. I have recommend Mr. Higgins and will continue to do so. He is a incredible attorney. Very professional and intelligent. He just gets it. At the end of the day he is also a real person and that is refreshing when it comes to an attorney (sorry, but it is). I have the up most respect for Mr. Alex Higgins. Oh and yes we did win the arbitration.</span><br /><br />

<li><h4>Alex Higgins - Amazing Lawyer and Great Person</h4>
<span class="review">I had the pleasure of working with Alex earlier this year and would recommend him to anyone looking for an attorney who understands labor & employment law. His professionalism and ability to immediately connect with me on all levels was impressive. He understood how to balance the emotional impact our case had on me, offering sound advice and setting realistic expectations. Alex is someone you want to work with because his is such a strong advocate for his clients, and truly "gets it". I can't thank Alex enough for what he did for me, and will continue to recommend him to anyone looking for an exceptional lawyer and great guy.</span><br /><br /><span class="poster">Posted by Wayne</span></li>

<li><h4>Excellent experience</h4>
<span class="review">I was referred to Alex by a local law firm to help me with an employment agreement. He was responsive (even when he was on vacation), helpful, thorough, thoughtful, detail-oriented and obviously experienced at this area of law. I've worked with a lot of lawyers in both a professional capacity as well as for personal business and he was definitely one of the good ones. 
<br /><br />
When things got emotional for me during one point of the negotiations, he offered counsel that was thoughtful yet unemotional. I appreciated that he was able to bring balance to the situation and that he wasn't out to use my emotions to drag out the situation. Instead, he helped me center on a compromise situation and represented my emotions to the other side (which meant a lot) but worked with me focus on the the long-term results.
<br /><BR />
I would definitely use him again. His prices were reasonable and he was easy to work with.</span>

<h4>Excellent experience with Alex</h4>
<span class="review">I initially consulted Alex on some questions when considering whether, and under what conditions, to leave my then-current employer. After a 45-minute discussion, I left with both clarity around the questions as well as a strategy/plan to move forward. At the time I was impressed with Alex's legal knowledge, his personable style, his efficiency, his ability to cut to the heart of a matter ... and the fact that I left with actionable advice. <br /><br />

I later engaged Alex to represent me on a matter related to unemployment insurance. Alex's knowledge of the relevant law, and his practical experience with the processes, enabled him to develop a strategy/plan. He coached me on my role in it. The outcome was positive. <br /><Br />

I thoroughly enjoyed working with Alex and even learned a few things about employment law and its application in Washington state. I respect Alex's intellect and knowledge ... and particularly value his pragmatic approach. He will not waste your time or money. I would recommend Alex to anyone looking for a similar experience.</span><br /><br />

<li><h4>Excellent Experience</h4>
<span class="review">I feel very fortunate to have been put in contact with Alex Higgins, for my unlawful termination/disability case. He has that unique combination of skills and professionalism, yet still extremely personable. His actions show he cares about his clients and I appreciated being able to trust that he was looking out for my best interests. Not only is he excellent at his work, hes also a fantastic human being!</span>

<li><h4>Intelligence, Expertise, and Compassion Make an Excellent Legal Advocate</h4>
<span class="review">I have never needed an attorney before and was dealing with a situation that was extremely stressful and was potentially life changing for me. I worked with one lawyer who was a complete waste of funds and then found Alex. 
<br /><br />
Alex is not only intelligent and was able to answer all of my legal questions easily, he demonstrated compassion - understanding that the extreme amount of stress I was under was taking a toll on my health. He made solid recommendations and guided me through the situation with confidence and expertise. 
<Br /><Br />
Alex was very conscious of my time and resources and his billing rates are extremely reasonable. 
<br /><br />
I will be honest: I was scared -- I didn't know how the situation would turn out and had never had to hire an attorney for any other matter. Alex helped me - he made sense of the legal terms and contracts and was able to negotiate a favorable outcome for me even though I placed rather tight time restrictions on him. 
<br /><br />
I would not hesitate to hire Alex again and would wholeheartedly recommend him.</span>

<li><h4>My first time ever needing help from an attorney and Alex really came through for me</h4>
<span class="review">It was my first time ever needing help from an attorney so I was very worried and it was hard for me to be trusting. But from the beginning Alex kept me informed every step of the way, so I was never searching for answers, he was honest even if it may have not been the best news and he was efficient. I was told that the timeframe for a case like mine could be a year or more and he had it completed in about 3 months and with a better result than what I had expected. Hiring him as my lawyer helped me to gain trust again and I know I would return to him in a heartbeat if I ever needed those services again.</span><br /><br />

<li><h4>Top-notch employment attorney</h4>
<span class="review">I highly recommend Alex. He represented me in an employment dispute, and I was extremely pleased with the work he did. I needed assistance over a fairly short time frame, and Alex provided timely, excellent representation that met all of my needs. His responsiveness more than exceeded my expectations. His extensive expertise in employment law was critical to the favorable outcome we achieved, and I particularly appreciated his pragmatic approach. Additionally, he is a pleasure to work with and has a great sense of humor. I don’t think anyone else could have done a better job for me.</span>

<li><h4>Excellent Attorney</h4>
<span class="review">In representing me, Alex proved to be knowledgeable, professional, compassionate, and highly ethical. I especially appreciated his kind approach as he separated the legal issues from the emotional, as well as his specific direction on documentation required to support my case. Throughout the process, he provided clear options and outlined the potential consequences of each. During discussions with my employer’s legal team, he was polite but firm, conducting the meetings with the calm confidence of the well-prepared. Alex kept me informed every step of the way, and he made it clear that I could contact him at any time if I had concerns or questions. When my very powerful employer became intransigent, Alex’s expertise proved invaluable as he effectively pressed for a fair resolution. I was very pleased with the resulting settlement, though Alex would gladly have taken it to the next level if I had wished. I felt I had the very best representation with a compassionate and skillful attorney who was more than a match for the opposition.</span><br /><br />

<li><h4>An excellent, top-notch advocate!</h4>
<span class="review">Alex was recommended to me by another client when I needed help with a very thorny employment matter. He was very professional, extremely helpful, and kept me fully informed at every step. When all was said and done, Alex had exceeded my expectations, and his fees were beyond reasonable! I have since recommended Alex to several of my friends, and will continue to do so!</span><br /><br />
<span class="poster">Posted by Jim Bernardo</span></li>

<li><h4>Smart &amp; Empathetic</h4>
<span class="review">Alex represented me in an employment claim brought against me as an individual defendant. He always kept me informed of the status of the matter and never used my time or my money unnecessarily. He was always thoughtful in our interactions, understanding the emotional component of such a situation. He knows all of the players in the Seattle employment law arena and is well-respected and liked. I would, and frequently do, recommend Alex to anyone, plaintiff or defendant, seeking intelligent, contientious and empathetic representation.</span>

<li><h4>Great attorney and person</h4>
<span class="review">Alex was very honest and straight forward regarding my case. He is very knowledgeable in employment law. He has kept me informed during each and every step in my case (even e-mailing me from his vacation in Africa). He gives his opinions and offers options, but is never pushy regarding my decisions. During my trial, Alex was very attentive and objected several times to my employers lines of questioning. We won. He has shown compassion and empathy for me during my employment situation. I would recommend Alex to anyone going through an employment situation.</span><br /><br />Posted by Eric</li>
<li><h4>Someone you can count on</h4>
<span class="review">Mr. Higgins is a legal resource you can count on. He is available and has flawless follow through. I have used him twice for employment issues and each time was completely impressed by his professionalism.</span><br /><br /><span class="poster">Posted by a Employment client</span></li>
<li><h4>Great lawyer.</h4>
<span class="review">Alex Higgins represented me in an employment-related matter in 2008. He was very professional, easy to reach, and very knowledgeable. Alex has a very courteous demeanor and was always polite and patient with the opposing side. I have and will continue to recommend Alex to others in need of counsel regarding employment issues.</span><bR /><br />
